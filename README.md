# [KeePassHelper Password Manager](https://github.com/belaviyo/keepass-macpass-helper)
A helper extension to use KeePass/MacPass/KeePassXC from Firefox, Opera, and Chrome browsers

Best credentials (username, password, PIN) Add-on (Extension) for KeePass for my needs. Supports not only local machine, but any machine in your LAN. Recent changes[^1] supports KeePass built-in[^2] OTP.

I have experience with Add-ons (Extensions):

Active:
* [KeePassXC-Browser](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser) (based on [chromeIPass](https://github.com/pfn/passifox) and some changes merged also from [KeePassHttp-Connector](https://github.com/smorks/keepasshttp-connector))
* [ChromeKeePass](https://github.com/RoelVB/ChromeKeePass)

Inactive:
* [KeePassHttp-Connector](https://github.com/smorks/keepasshttp-connector) (forked from chromeIPass/passIFox)
* [PassIFox](https://github.com/pfn/passifox) (for Mozilla Firefox), [chromeIPass](https://github.com/pfn/passifox) (for Google Chrome)
