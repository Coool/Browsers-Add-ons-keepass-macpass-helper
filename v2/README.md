## KeePassHelper password manager

KeyPassHelper Password Manager is a browser extension to get credentials from KeePass or KeePass like applications (MacPass, KeePassX, KeePassXC, ...). It also allows you to directly save new credentials to the application.

#### Notes:

1. This extension is not storing your credentials internally. You need to have a KeePass compatible application installed in your operating system or retrieve or save your credentials.
2. By default, KeePass application does not allow password transmission through HTTP protocol. Make sure you have KeePassHttp (or an equivalent) plug-in installed in your password manager application.
